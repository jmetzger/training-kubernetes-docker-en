# Container

```
contains all of these:
- software
- libraries
- tools 
- configuration data 
- no own kernel
- good for executing applications in different enviroments

benefits:
- Containers are decoupled (entkoppelt)
- Containers are independent from each other
- They are able to communicate through a well defined interface to exchange information

by decoupling containers:
- solve problems with libraries, tools, databases (different applications needing different version)
```
